        <h2>About the Breeder</h2>
        <h5>
            I'm the breeder behind Hannah's Haus & Farm located in Atoka, OK. My husband, I, our dogs live on our 40 acre farm.
            Our dogs are very loved and well-socialized. I strive to make sure every owner has the ability to get the very best out of their puppy.
            Our dogs live as part of our family in our home. The puppies will too until they go to their forever home.

            <div class="col-sm-10">
            <p>
                Our dogs live with us in our home and we make accommodation for them just as if
                we make accomodation and upgrades for our selves. Our friends have said they would
                like to come back as one of our dogs when they pass.

            <h4>A little more about the owner</h4>
            <p>
                We have three boys that are grown and not living at home now. Our three dogs are our only
                kids living at home now. We truly do not understand how people can be complete without dogs as part of the family.
                Our dogs have been emotional support that helped us get through cancer and the residuals from it now. We
                want to be a part of transitioning that perfect "pet quality" puppy to the perfect family.

            <h4>How we got into breeding</h4>
            <p>
                Years ago when we were searching for our own giant
                schnauzer to bring into our home; we realized how difficult
                it was finding a giant that was born into a loving well
                socialized breeders home environment. Our family finally met a fantastic breeder out of state
                and thats where it all began with Hannah. Our goal is to share the same happiness our giants bring
                us with others, while making our giants happiness the first priority. We are taking this one litter at time with the
                advice from our vet and us knowing our own pets and listening to them as well.
