## üìö Documentation Overview

This documentation suite uses [Mermaid JS](https://mermaid.js.org/) for all diagrams, which render automatically in GitHub, GitLab, VS Code (with Mermaid extension), and most modern markdown viewers.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Database Schema Diagrams** - Entity Relationship Diagrams showing table structures and relationships
- **Architecture Diagrams** - Authentication and authorization flow visualizations
- **Workflow Diagrams** - Business process flows including the adoption application workflow

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Documentation

### Database Schema

#### [Core Domain ERD](architecture/database-erd-core.md)
**Entity Relationship Diagram - Core Business Entities**

Visualizes the primary domain model for the dog adoption system:
- **Tables**: `users`, `dogs`, `dog_application`, `pickup_methods`
- **Key Relationships**:
  - Users submit adoption applications for dogs
  - Dogs have optional current owners (nullable userId)
  - Applications track approval workflow
- **Patterns Highlighted**:
  - Tri-state approval system (approved: "-1", "0", "1")
  - Soft delete pattern (retired/adopted flags)
  - Admin authorization via isAdmin flag

**When to use this diagram:** Understanding the core business entities and how adoption applications link users to dogs.

---

#### [User Profile & Lookup Tables ERD](architecture/database-erd-lookups.md)
**Entity Relationship Diagram - User Profile & Reference Data**

Documents the user profile structure and all lookup/reference tables:
- **Tables**: `users`, `countries`, `states`, `housing_types`, `contact_methods`, `userContactPreferences`
- **Key Relationships**:
  - Geographic hierarchy (countries ‚Üí states) with CASCADE delete
  - User profile foreign keys to lookup tables
  - Many-to-many contact preferences via junction table
- **Patterns Highlighted**:
  - Comprehensive user profile fields (housing, family, pet history)
  - Lookup table pattern for dropdowns
  - Many-to-many junction table for contact preferences

**When to use this diagram:** Understanding user profile data requirements, geographic data relationships, or lookup table structures.

---

### Authentication & Authorization

#### [Authentication & Authorization Flow](architecture/auth-flow.md)
**Complete Security Model Documentation**

Comprehensive documentation of the authentication and authorization system:

**Diagrams Included:**
1. **Login Authentication Sequence** - Step-by-step login process with all components
2. **Authorization Decision Flowchart** - How policy-based authorization determines access
3. **Role Hierarchy & Permissions** - Three-tier role system (Guest, User, Admin)

**Key Topics:**
- Email-based authentication with session management
- Policy-based authorization using CakePHP authorization plugin
- Admin privilege escalation (isAdmin flag)
- Resource ownership patterns (users can edit own profiles)
- Security considerations (bcrypt, CSRF, session security)

**When to use this diagram:** Understanding how login works, how permissions are checked, or implementing new authorization policies.

---

## üíº Workflow Documentation

### Adoption Process

#### [Dog Adoption Application Workflow](workflows/adoption-process.md)
**Complete Adoption Process from Application to Completion**

Detailed documentation of the multi-step adoption workflow:

**Diagrams Included:**
1. **Application State Machine** - All application states and transitions
2. **User Adoption Journey** - Sequence diagram showing complete user experience
3. **Admin Approval Decision Process** - Flowchart for admin review and approval

**Key Topics:**
- Tri-state approval system (Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected ‚Üí Completed)
- User application submission process
- Admin review and approval workflow
- Dog availability management (retired/adopted flags)
- Pickup method selection and coordination
- Edge case handling (cancellations, concurrent applications)

**When to use this diagram:** Understanding the adoption business process, implementing approval features, or troubleshooting application state issues.

## üîç Diagram Types Used

This documentation uses several Mermaid diagram types:

### Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- **Purpose**: Visualize database schema, tables, columns, and relationships
- **Used In**: database-erd-core.md, database-erd-lookups.md
- **Notation**:
  - `||--o{` = One-to-many
  - `||--||` = One-to-one
  - `}o--o{` = Many-to-many

### Sequence Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Show interactions between components over time
- **Used In**: auth-flow.md (login sequence), adoption-process.md (user journey)
- **Components**: Users, Controllers, Services, Database

### State Diagrams
- **Purpose**: Visualize state transitions and lifecycles
- **Used In**: adoption-process.md (application states)
- **Notation**: States, transitions, terminal states

### Flowcharts
- **Purpose**: Decision trees and process flows
- **Used In**: auth-flow.md (authorization decisions), adoption-process.md (admin approval)
- **Notation**: Rectangles (processes), Diamonds (decisions), Arrows (flow)

## üé® Diagram Style Guide

For consistency across all diagrams:

### Naming Conventions
- **Table Names**: Use exact database names (e.g., `dog_application`, not `DogApplication`)
- **Column Names**: Use camelCase as in database (e.g., `userId`, `dateCreated`)
- **Entity Names**: Match CakePHP model names (e.g., User, Dog, DogApplication)

### Visual Standards
- Use consistent cardinality notation in ERDs
- Label all relationships with meaningful descriptions
- Include legends for complex diagrams
- Keep diagrams focused (split large schemas into multiple diagrams)
- Use notes to highlight non-standard patterns

### Documentation Standards
- Include "Last Updated" date on every page
- Provide context and overview before showing diagrams
- Explain diagram components after showing visuals
- Reference source code files with line numbers when applicable
- Cross-link related documentation
